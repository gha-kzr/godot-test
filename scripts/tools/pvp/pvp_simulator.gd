## Plays PvP matches between AIs (both sides use EnemyAI) on the real PvP rules and maps: the numbers behind
## `tools/pvp_balance.gd`. The AI plays worse than a player (it never plans two turns ahead and does not know a
## class's tricks), so read the results as a lower bound and as a way to spot a class that is far off.
