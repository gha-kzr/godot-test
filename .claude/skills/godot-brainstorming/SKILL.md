# Godot Brainstorming

A structured design process for Godot 4.3+ features and systems — from blank slate to a clear scene tree, signal map, and data flow before you write a single line of implementation code.

> **Related skills:** **godot-grill** for settling open design decisions first, **godot-code-review** for reviewing the implementation.

---

## Process: How to Brainstorm

Do NOT jump straight to designing. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Settle the decisions
If the request has open design decisions (scope, dimension, authority, data home, …), invoke the `godot-grill` skill and let it run to its end. Skip it when a record in the project's decisions or ADR directory already covers this feature, or the user has stated the decisions. Either way, check what already exists (code, scenes, assets). Carry the record into Step 2 — approaches must respect its settled rows.

### Step 2: Propose 2-3 approaches
With the decisions settled, propose architectural options with trade-offs. For example:
- "Enum FSM vs Node FSM for your state machine — here's when each fits"
- "EventBus vs direct signals for your systems — here's the trade-off"
Lead with your recommendation and explain why.

### Step 3: Design with approval
Present the design section by section (scene tree, signal map, data flow). Ask "does this look right?" after each section before continuing.

### Step 4: Prepare for implementation

After the design is approved:

1. **Create implementation plan** — Break the design into ordered tasks. Save it where the project's instructions say; otherwise ask the user, suggesting `docs/plans/`.

2. **Annotate each task with patterns** — Every task that involves a Godot system lists the known pattern or best practice it follows (e.g. node-based state machine, signal-up/call-down), so the implementing agent doesn't improvise one. Example:

   - [ ] **Task 3: Player movement** — Create CharacterBody3D with walk, sprint, jump.
     Pattern: CharacterBody3D + Input Map actions, coyote time and jump buffer.

## 1. When to Use

Start here whenever you are:

- **Adding a new feature** — a chest, a dialogue system, a crafting bench, a skill tree
- **Creating a new scene** — you need to decide what nodes it contains and how they communicate
- **Choosing between approaches** — inheritance vs. composition, Autoload vs. Resource, 2D vs. 3D
- **Feeling stuck on structure** — the code works but the scene tree feels wrong
- **Onboarding someone** — you need to explain the design of an existing system

If you already know exactly what nodes you need and how they connect, skip this skill and build. Use it when uncertainty is slowing you down.

## 2. Scene Tree Planning

Sketch the scene tree on paper (or in a comment block) before opening the Godot editor. The goal is to answer three questions for every node:

1. **What does this node own?** (data, child nodes, visual representation)
2. **What does this node do?** (its single responsibility)
3. **How does it talk to neighbors?** (signals up, method calls down, EventBus sideways)

### Planning Steps

1. Name the root node and its type — this defines the scene's contract with the world.
2. List immediate children by responsibility group, not by Godot node type.
3. Assign a Godot node type to each entry.
4. Identify every signal the scene emits and every signal it consumes.
5. Mark which nodes should be separate `.tscn` files (reuse candidates).

### Example: Planning a "Chest" Interactable

**Step 1 — Name and root type**

A `Chest` is a world object the player walks up to and opens. It is not a physics body; it does not move. Root: `StaticBody2D` or `Node2D`.

**Step 2 — Responsibility groups**

- Visual representation (sprite, animation)
- Collision / interaction trigger (detect player proximity)
- Loot data (what items are inside)
- UI feedback (prompt label, open animation trigger)
- State (is it open or closed?)

**Step 3 — Assign node types**

```
Chest (StaticBody2D)
├── Sprite2D                  # closed/open frame, or swap texture on open
├── AnimationPlayer           # open animation
├── CollisionShape2D          # physical body shape (blocks player)
├── InteractionArea (Area2D)  # detect when player is close enough
│   └── CollisionShape2D      # slightly larger than body shape
├── PromptLabel (Label3D or Label) # "Press F to open"
└── LootTable (Node)          # holds @export var items: Array[ItemData]
```

**Step 4 — Signal map**

| Signal | Emitted by | Connected to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `body_entered(body)` | `InteractionArea` | `Chest._on_area_body_entered` | Show prompt when player enters range |
| `body_exited(body)` | `InteractionArea` | `Chest._on_area_body_exited` | Hide prompt when player leaves |
| `opened(loot: Array[ItemData])` | `Chest` | `InventorySystem` or `EventBus` | Deliver loot to whoever owns the inventory |
| `animation_finished(name)` | `AnimationPlayer` | `Chest._on_animation_finished` | Lock chest after open animation completes |

**Step 5 — Reuse candidates**

`LootTable` is likely reused by barrels, enemies, and shop crates — extract it as a separate `.tscn` component.

For the resulting GDScript and C# `Chest` sketches, plus the four-part design entry (Scene Tree, Node Responsibilities, Signal Map, Data Flow) used to document this design, see [references/example-chest.md](references/example-chest.md).

## 3. Picking Node Types and Dimension

Two lookups belong here but are pure recall — load them only when the answer is not already obvious:

- **Which node for which need?** `CharacterBody` vs `RigidBody` vs `StaticBody` vs `Area`, UI vs world-space labels, particles, cameras, spawn markers.
- **2D, 3D, or 2.5D?** Selection criteria for each, hybrid techniques (billboarded sprites, orthographic 3D, SubViewport UI), and the performance consequences.

Two Godot 4.3+ specifics are easy to get wrong and worth stating up front: tile-based levels use **`TileMapLayer`** (one layer per node — `TileMap` is deprecated), and blend-tree locomotion needs an **`AnimationTree`** paired with an `AnimationPlayer`, not an `AnimationPlayer` alone.

## 4. Questions to Ask Before Building

Work through this checklist before creating your first node.

- [ ] **What data does this system need?** — List every piece of state: position, health, item count, flags
- [ ] **Who owns each piece of data?** — Assign one authoritative owner per value; avoid duplicating state
- [ ] **How does it communicate?** — Signals up the tree, method calls down, EventBus for cross-system events
- [ ] **Can it be reused?** — If yes, it should be a separate `.tscn` scene with a clean `@export` interface
- [ ] **Does it need persistence?** — If the data must survive scene changes or game restarts, plan a save system early
- [ ] **What is the scene tree?** — Sketch at least two levels deep before touching the editor
- [ ] **What signals does it emit?** — List every signal name, its arguments, and who connects to it
- [ ] **What are the failure modes?** — What happens if a required node is missing? If a signal fires twice?
- [ ] **What is the minimum viable version?** — Build that first; add complexity only when it is needed

## 5. Common Architecture Decisions

| If you need... | Consider... | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Global state accessible anywhere | **Autoload (singleton)** | Registered in Project Settings; available as a named global |
| Data shared between multiple scenes | **Resource (`.tres` / `.res`)** | Saved as an asset; `@export`-able; survives scene reloads |
| Reusable behavior across entity types | **Component scene** | Instantiate as a child; each entity opts in by including the scene |
| Complex entity behavior with many states | **State machine** | Explicit enter/exit per state; prevents if-chain sprawl |
| Events between systems that don't share a parent | **EventBus Autoload** | Decouples sender and receiver; any node can connect |
| Data that must persist across sessions | **Save system with JSON or binary** | Serialize Resource or Dictionary; load on `_ready` |
| Configurable game data (stats, items, levels) | **Resource with `@export` fields** | Edit values in the Inspector; no code change required |
| Spawning scenes at runtime | **`PackedScene` + `instantiate()`** | Store `@export var scene: PackedScene`; call `scene.instantiate()` |
| Running code on a delay or interval | **Timer node** | Cleaner than `_process` frame counters; supports one-shot and loop |
| Gradual transitions (fade, lerp, tween) | **Tween** | `create_tween()` is built-in; no extra node required in Godot 4 |

## 6. Design Output Format

Capture your design in a comment block at the top of the root script, or in a `DESIGN.md` file next to the scene. A complete design entry has four parts: a **scene tree ASCII diagram**, a **node responsibilities table**, a **signal map** (signal → source → consumer → payload), and a **data flow** trace showing how a triggering event propagates through the tree.

See [references/example-chest.md](references/example-chest.md) for a fully worked four-part entry built around the `Chest` interactable.
